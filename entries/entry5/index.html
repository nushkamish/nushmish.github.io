 <strong>10/09/2023 </strong><br > <br> <b>A Suburban Sunday with Sai.</b><br> I've heard so many people say "I need to get out of the city." Well, this week it was my turn. <em>I NEEDED to get out of the city.</em> Not the city, maybe, just my thoughts. I have a lovely roommate who offered me a train ride and a weekend in Princeton and like you would assume by now, I jumped at that offer. It's funny, I usually go down to the East River to "escape my thoughts", the river was *NOT* enough this week. I felt homesick, homesick for who I was. Who was I? Who were we all? Kids. I saw a lot of children this weekend. I have a weird feeling when I look at kids these days. I wanna be them again!

	<em>UP</em> <br> <br>

	When will my feet touch the ground? <br>
	When will I be old enough to go across town? <br>
	When will I stand out in the crowd with this gown?<br>
	All these questions I asked because, <br>
	I thought this gush of air would always be around.<br> <br>

	Now I stand a little far, looking back at the lot,<br>
	Who am I now? Where have I come from?<br>
	I see the glimmer in their eyes, <br>
	Going to sleep without a sigh. <br> <br>

	I want to go sit on my swing, <br>
	far away from the ground so I can win. <br>
