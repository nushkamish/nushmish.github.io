 <strong>10/15/2023 </strong> <br>  <br>My head is clouded by conversations this week. When my thoughts aren't occupied with all the work I have and I have to sit with myself, conversations I've had start start coming into my head. Things I said, things they said. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about time. It's overwhelming to me that it's already October. I remember flying back to the city in January to start my second (and last) semester as a freshman and now it's October. I'm not a freshman anymore. It's starting to get cold out again. I've flown in and out of the city again. Why is that overwhelming? It's time. It's just time, it will pass. What's so scary? I don't know but what I do know from a conversation from my dad and I, We get up, we dress up, we show up. No matter what.

	Who am I going to be today? <br>
	I look into the mirror, staring at my face, <br>
	What taints, what traits?<br>
	Who do I choose today? <br>
	<br> <br>

	I wish there was a way,<br>
	to help me get through this day. <br>
	It doesn't sit right, <br>
	What I'm about to write,<br>
	I paint away a mask that fits just right, <br>
	<br> <br>

	A strong face and a smile, <br>
	Someone who has might, <br>
	Someone who can help me get through this night.<br>
